    Yeah
    I've been tryna call
    I've been on my own for long enough
    Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
    I'm going through withdrawals
    You don't even have to do too much
    You can turn me on with just a touch, baby
    I look around and
    Sin City's cold and empty (oh)
    No one's around to judge me (oh)
    I can't see clearly when you're gone
    I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the light
    No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
    I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
    Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
    (Hey, hey, hey)
    
    I'm running out of time
    'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
    So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh
    The city's cold and empty (oh)
    No one's around to judge me (oh)
    I can't see clearly when you're gone
    I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
    No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
    I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
    Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
    I'm just walking by to let you know (by to let you know)
    I can never say it on the phone (say it on the phone)
    Will never let you go this time (ooh)
    I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
    No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
    (Hey, hey, hey)
    (Hey, hey, hey)
    
    I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
    No, I can't sleep until I feel your touchs</pre>
